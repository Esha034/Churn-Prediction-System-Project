# Churn-Prediction-System-Project
This project is a hands-on machine learning solution to predict customer churn—i.e., which customers are likely to stop using a service. Churn prediction is critical in industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking, where retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

📌 Project Overview
In this project, I:

-Explored and cleaned real-world customer data

-Engineered features like contract type, payment method, and usage metrics

-Trained and evaluated classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

-Analyzed churn probabilities and key drivers

-Visualized insights using Power BI and Matplotlib

🎯 Objectives:
-Predict the probability of churn for each customer

-Understand which factors most influence churn

-Support decision-makers with actionable insights

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
-Python – Core language.

-Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation.

-Scikit-learn– Machine learning.

-Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization.

-Power BI – Business dashboard.

📁 Dataset:
-Telco Customer Churn Dataset – Available on Kaggle

📈 Results:
The final model achieved strong performance in predicting churn and helped identify at-risk customer segments. The dashboard/report presents clear business recommendations to reduce churn and boost customer retention.
